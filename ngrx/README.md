## How to run the project

0. Precondition: You have installed globally: `nodejs` with `npm`.
1. Install dependencies - run `npm install`, or `yarn install`
1. run fake-api, based on .json files (`json-server` package used) from repository root/server: go there and run `npm start`
1. run application dev server in watch by `npm start`
1. the application should be available under `localhost:4200`

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Mock API

Run `npm start` in [~/server](../server) to run `json-server` instance.

If you want to play with it => its data is configured in [db.json file](../server/db.json)
