# NGXS - yet another Angular state management library

This repository contains code samples for my presentation called "NGXS - yet another Angular state management library", about ... [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs/) :smirk:

## Content :rocket:

For comparison between [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs/), popular [ngrx](http://ngrx.github.io/) and [Akita](https://netbasal.gitbook.io/akita/) I created three projects in this repository. All of them have their README.md files linked above:

* [ngxs example](./ngxs) :speedboat:
* [ngrx example](./ngrx) :helicopter:
* [akita example](./akita) 🐶


## Mock API

To run **any** of the applications run server
Run `npm install` then `npm start` in [~/server](../server) to run `json-server` instance.

If you want to play with it => its data is configured in [db.json file](../server/db.json)

Official documentation of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
